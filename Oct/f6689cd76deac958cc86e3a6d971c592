Middelburg – Three people were injured following a 13-vehicle collision on the N4, approximately 5km outside of Middleburg in Mpumalanga, paramedics said on Monday. It is understood that a driver of a truck apparently lost control, causing the vehicle to crash into several others apparently riding in convoy as part of the #BlackMonday protest action taking place across the country against the rising number of farm murders in South Africa.  ER24 spokeperson Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene at approximately 10.40am. “Upon further inspection, paramedics found that 10 vehicles and three trucks were completely blocking the entire one side of the road. Several vehicles were found overturned on the grassy embankment. “Local law enforcement began to close off the road and divert the traffic while paramedics assessed the patients,” said Meiring. “Two people were found to have sustained serious injuries while one other had only moderate injuries.” The patients were transported to a nearby hospital in Middelburg for further treatment, Meiring said.
