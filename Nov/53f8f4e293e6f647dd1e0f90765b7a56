Two girls, believed to be ten-years-old, were killed and twelve other children injured this morning when a small taxi collided with a light motor vehicle collided on 5th Road in Cloverdene, east of Johannesburg. ER24 paramedics, along with another service, arrived on the scene at 07h55 to find the small taxi lying on its side in the middle of the road. A light motor vehicle was found parked a short distance away. Several children were found walking around on the scene while two girls were found lying approximately ten metres away from the taxi. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that two girls, believed to be ten-years-old, were found to have sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead. Twelve other children, that had been traveling in the small taxi at the time, were assessed by paramedics. Assessments showed that the children, aged between 9 and 11, were found to have sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. The patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to Sunshine Private Hospital for further treatment. The driver of the taxi, as well as the mother and two children from the light motor vehicle, were assessed and found to have escaped injury. The exact cause of the collision is not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
