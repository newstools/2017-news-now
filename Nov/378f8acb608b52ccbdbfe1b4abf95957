Eight people were left injured on Saturday morning following a collision between a taxi and light motor vehicle at the Govan Mbeki and Nelson Mandela Drive in Potchefstroom. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene and found the taxi lying on its side on the side of the road. The light motor vehicle was found parked just a short distance away. Several passengers that had been travelling inside the taxi had already climbed out of the vehicle and were found walking around on the scene. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that eight had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. Fortunately, no serious injuries or fatalities were found at the scene. The patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to Mediclinic Potchefstroom and Potchefstroom Provincial Hospital for further care. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
