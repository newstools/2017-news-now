The police in Bloemfontein have found the body believed to be of a missing 42-year-old woman at Raditaba sewage dam in Hamilton on Friday. Police spokesperson, Thandi Mbambo, says the deceased was reported missing after confronting her neighbour over a tree hanging into her yard. Mbambo says upon investigation into the neighbour’s yard, traces of blood, possible human flesh and a burnt mattress were found and samples were referred to the lab for forensic tests.  She says after several attempts to tracking down the neighbour, he was finally arrested in Phase 9, Mangaung, on Friday and after much interrogation led the police to the dam where the body was found. Mbambo says forensic tests will be conducted on the recovered body to determine the cause of death, to positively confirm if it is that of the reported missing woman, and to check if it matches to traces of blood and human flesh recovered at the neighbour`s house. She says the 23-year-old suspect charged with murder is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court tomorrow, November 13.OFM News
