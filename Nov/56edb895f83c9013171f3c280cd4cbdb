Media Statement
12 November 2017 JMPD officers attacked while enforcing City’s By-law  The City of Joburg’s Public Safety Department strongly condemns the attack on a JMPD officer and a driver of JMPD tow truck shortly before midday on Sunday, 12 November 2017.  The attack took place when the two officials hooked up an illegally parked car which belongs to a member of a church on Claim Street Hillbrow as it was causing traffic congestion.  From interim investigations, it is believed that the JMPD officer drew his firearm and fired into the air to stop the rioting congregants from advancing toward them, but the crowd did not heed the warning but proceeded to attack the officer.  The mob overpowered and disarmed the officer, who was beaten and left unconscious and had to be rushed to Milpark Hospital.  The assailants went to hand in the firearm at Johannesburg Central Police Station. Upon arrival at the station, one member of the congregation was detained by the SAPS for illegally being in possession of a JMPD firearm.  Public Safety MMC Michael Sun strongly condemns the mob attack on the metro police when officers are doing their job and executing City’s By-laws. “We will not allow this attack on our Metro Police go unprosecuted, the culprits will have to face the full might of the law”, said MMC
Sun.  This incident will be investigated and the culprits will be brought down to face prosecution.  The Department wishes the officer, who is still being treated in hospital, a speedy recovery.
