Cape Town – A video has surfaced online of a Mitchells Plain crèche owner allegedly caught on camera smacking a child at her facility. She has been accused of abusing kids at the Darul Ghair Islamic Based Educare Centre in Portland. A fed up teacher who has since resigned from the “crèche from hell”, putting it in her own words, filmed one of the abuse incidents which has since gone viral on social media. She claims the owner, Gaironiesa Abrahams frequently beats the children, and in two instances she filmed the woman slapping two little boys. In one of the videos, a woman believed to be Abrahams, bends over a three-year-old child sitting on the floor, and repeatedly smacks him. She asks him: “Hoekom byt jy my kind, ha? (Why are you biting my child?)” The child screams and the 10-second video ends. Watch video below:
