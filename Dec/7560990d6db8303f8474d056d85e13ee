Cape Town –  Five people, including a five-year-old boy, were injured on Friday, in a shooting outside a shop in the Steenberg area in the Western Cape, paramedics said. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said that paramedics, the metro police and Life Healthcare, were called to a nearby residence on Choir Street. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that five boys, aged between five and 20, had sustained numerous gunshot wounds. The five-year-old boy was in a serious condition while the remaining four had sustained minor to moderate injuries,” he said. “Paramedics treated the patients and provided the seriously injured boy with advanced life support interventions before they were transported to nearby hospitals for further treatment.  “It is understood that the boys had been standing outside the shop when a vehicle, with an unknown number of gunmen, had opened fire. The boys then ran to the nearby residence.” He said that local authorities were on the scene to investigate. Western Cape police were not immediately available for comment. African News Agency
