2 x Bravo male perps in getaway blue Toyota Corolla REG: FN73ZCGP The extreme aggression displayed by the perps, their shooting at an unarmed mother & child & the manner in which the TV is ripped off the wall & damaged, one has to wonder if this was not a hate crime? Senior police officials under instruction from corrupt politicians who try & bully communities into not posting about crime on social media are in our opinion helping mask & hide the extent of violent crime in South Africa. South African courts reportedly have a successful conviction rate of less than 5% – therefore keeping the crimes quiet by not posting the crimes on social media will in our opinion not make any difference – surely it is in the public interest to warn people about the danger they face. If a perpetrator has been successfully arrested then his / her identity should be hidden from the public to try ensure a fair trial. GP, WEST RAND, ROODEPOORT, FLORIDA, THISTLE ST
