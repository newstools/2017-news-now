Johannesburg – Soweto police have promised come down hard on criminals who attack officers on the job. This follows an incident on Tuesday in Jabulani when a police officer was shot at by four criminals. According to Jabulani police spokesperson Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng, officers were patrolling around the Jabulani flats when they noticed a suspicious vehicle with four occupants. “When the officers approached the car, one of them came out of the car and tried to disarm a police officer. During the struggle the other three suspects came out of the vehicle and one of them fired shots towards police,” Mashiteng said. A shoot-out ensued between the suspects and police officers. This led to the death of one of the suspects and an officer was injured. He was rushed to hospital for treatment and Mashiteng said he is recovering well.  The three other suspects fled and police have launched a manhunt for them. Mashiteng said once the police checked the vehicle the suspects were travelling in, it was discovered it had been hijacked in Jeppe some time last month. He said police were appealing to the public to respect officers during the festive season as they are working hard to protect them from criminality. “An intensive festive season police visibility and search has  ensured there is one less criminal on the streets. Gauteng will never be the same,” Mashiteng said.
