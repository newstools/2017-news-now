Potchefstroom â€“ Six people were left injured Friday afternoon, one critically, following a head-on collision between a light motor vehicle and bakkie on the N12, approximately 18km outside of Potchefstroom. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find the light motor vehicle in the centre median while the bakkie was found in the middle of the road. Several patients were found walking around on the scene. Upon closer inspection, paramedics found one patient, a woman, lying in the rear of the light motor vehicle. Assessments showed that the woman had sustained numerous injuries, leaving her in a critical condition, while five other patients had sustained minor to moderate injuries. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured woman with advanced life support interventions.
Once treated, the critically injured woman was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to a private hospital in Johannesburg. The remaining patients were transported by ambulance to Potchefstroom Provincial hospital for further care. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. ArriveAlive
