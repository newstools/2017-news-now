Durban – Three people, including a 6-month-old baby were killed in two separate crashes along the N3 at Van Reenen’s Pass between Harrismith and Ladysmith in the early hours of on Friday morning. In the first crash, two people were killed when three trucks, three minibus taxis and a car collided near the Caltex petrol station. In the second crash, at least two kilometres from the first scene, one person was killed after two trucks collided. Con Roux, N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) commercial manager said at the top of Van Reenen’s Pass, in a southbound direction, a four-kilometre diesel spill. “The spill is compounding the traffic problems currently being experienced. The entire road had to be closed for recovery. Mop up operations are underway and all resources have been deployed, and good progress is being made, but it is expected to take a few hours before the entire route can be cleared and re-opened to traffic,” Roux said. Motorists are advised to either delay their journeys or to make use of the R74 (Oliviershoek Pass) as an alternative route. “Drive with care. Wet weather conditions are being experienced along the route,” Roux said. Heavy haul trucks were not allowed on the alternate route so traffic is expected to be heavily backed up for most of the day. This could possibly hamper travel plans for those hoping to get into or out of KZN today. Daily News
